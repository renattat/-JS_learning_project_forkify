# forkify Project

This is my JavaScript project for learning purposes: 
Recipe application with custom reccipe uploads

I want to say that this is not my own product. I don't create the disign.

I took completed by instructor files such as: index.html and style.css and others.

My work is in the js files (controller.js, model.js, views and others).

Here I learned and practiced some JS topics:

-- Working with external service API
-- Impelemnting MVC Architecture
-- Event Handlers in MVC: Publisher-Subscriber Pattern
-- Developing a DOM Updating Algorithm
-- Deployment on Netlify server.
